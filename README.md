# CSS-Fun-Maybe

New Skills Attempted:

  * Used flex to build a card table
  * The card table consisted of three rows
  * Each row had four cards
  
  * Messed around with images and mouse over
  * Set a standard image as the back of the 12 cards facing the user
  * On mouseover, the card flips to reveal a new image
  * There are six pairs of images
  * Attempted to make a matching game, but not quite working
  
  * Had fun with this despite my trepidation with CSS
